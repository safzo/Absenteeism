# Absenteeism
This repo consists of a business case study to determine how likely an employee is to be absent during a work day.

The goal was to develop a model that would predict the probability of an individual being excessively absent from work. The model used in this case study is a logistic regression model. After preprocessing the data, training the ML model, and testing it on an unseen dataset, Tableau was used to analyze three separate dependencies between the inputs of this model.
